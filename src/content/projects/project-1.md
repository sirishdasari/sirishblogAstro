**Project Overview:**
Smart Water Bottle is a revolutionary hydration solution designed to help users stay hydrated throughout the day. With a focus on user engagement and real-time tracking, the Smart Water Bottle encourages healthy hydration habits and ensures users meet their daily water intake goals.

## Objectives

1. Provide an always-on time display (digital clock) with configurable reminder schedules (fixed times, intervals, and smart cadence based on user activity).
2. Built-in buzzer supporting multiple selectable tones and sequences, adjustable volume, and user-configurable alert patterns (set via on-device controls or companion app).
3. Integrated RGB lighting module with fully customizable colors, animations, brightness, and mapping to alert types or hydration levels.
4. Bluetooth/Wi‑Fi connectivity and a companion app to configure time, reminders, buzzer tones, light presets, schedules, and to perform OTA firmware updates.
5. Low-power hardware design with battery level monitoring, efficient sleep modes, and a water-resistant enclosure suitable for daily use.
6. Local logging of hydration events with optional cloud sync, user history, and analytics to adapt reminder cadence.
7. Simple UX: on-device buttons for quick snooze, silence, or manual hydration logging plus app-based presets and profiles for different users or use cases.
8. Develop a user-friendly mobile app that motivates individuals to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives.
9. Utilize gamification elements to make sustainable living fun and interactive.
10. Provide educational resources and personalized challenges to empower users to make informed eco-conscious decisions.
